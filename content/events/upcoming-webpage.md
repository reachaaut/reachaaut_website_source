## Lecturer

Daniel is an Associate Professor in Data Science & Innovation Economics at the Aalborg University Business School, where he leads the Data Science research track at the AI:Growth lab. His research is dedicated to the development and application of data-driven methods to map, understand, and predict technological change, and its causes and consequences for socioeconomic systems on various levels of aggregation. His current contextual focus is the dynamics of AI research and industry. 

His research is featured in leading academic journals such as Research Policy, but also attracted attention and funding from the industry, and lead to price-winning applications. Daniel is actively engaged in initiatives to educate (social science) students & researchers, professionals, and policymakers in understanding, evaluating, and applying modern Data Science and Artificial Intelligence methods for data-driven decision making. 

## Description
For many academics, particularly graduate students, post-docs, and early career researchers, having an online presence showcasing their academic work and achievements is an important component for advancing their research and career. A common way to do this is by creating and maintaining a personal website, which provides the opportunity to describe your research interests, highlight recent publications, and share your CV all in one location. 

However, many do not know where or how to begin this process. University internal solutions are often slow and clunky, and link the individual researcher directly to a certain institution. There are also many different services that allow people to create their own websites, but often these services are pricey and do not provide formats that are optimized for sharing academic work. One solution is to build a website using the free, opensource software R and facilitating packages designed specifically for creating websites to highlight academic work. We will directly host this website on Github, the leading free provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control.


## Preparation
This is not mandatory and can also be done afterwards. However, in case you want to “follow-along” and start building your first website already during the workshop, make sure the following steps are covered upfront:

* **1. Github hello world:** Set up a github account and get insights in the basic functionality by following this 15 min. tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 

* **2. R installation:** Download and install the latest R distribution under:  https://cran.r-project.org/ 

* **3. Rstudio installation:** Download and install the latest version of RStudio under: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 

* **4. Prepare some own content** you would like on the website (eg. about me, recent papers/projects description text etc. fx in Word; have a picture ready)
