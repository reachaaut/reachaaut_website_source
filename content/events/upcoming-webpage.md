## Lecturer

Daniel is an Associate Professor in Data Science & Innovation Economics at the Aalborg University Business School, where he leads the Data Science research track at the AI:Growth lab. His research is dedicated to the development and application of data-driven methods to map, understand, and predict technological change, and its causes and consequences for socioeconomic systems on various levels of aggregation. His current contextual focus is the dynamics of AI research and industry. 

His research is featured in leading academic journals such as Research Policy, but also attracted attention and funding from the industry, and lead to price-winning applications. Daniel is actively engaged in initiatives to educate (social science) students & researchers, professionals, and policymakers in understanding, evaluating, and applying modern Data Science and Artificial Intelligence methods for data-driven decision making. 

## Description
For many academics, particularly graduate students, post-docs, and early career researchers, having an online presence showcasing their academic work and achievements is an important component for advancing their research and career, and disseminate research findings fast and to a broad audience.

The ability to fast and easy create webpages and populate them with material can be used to provide open access summaries of their findings, but also to serve as a repository for online events, PhD courses, special sessions on conferences and the like.In addition, researchers can use the same workflow create and maintain a personal website, which provides the opportunity to describe your research interests, highlight recent publications, and share your CV all in one location. 

However, many do not know where or how to begin this process. In this workshop, we will use R and facilitating packages designed specifically for creating websites to highlight academic work. We will directly host this website on Github, the leading free provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control.



## Preparation
This is not mandatory and can also be done afterwards. However, in case you want to “follow-along” and start building your first website already during the workshop, make sure the following steps are covered upfront:

* **1. Github hello world:** Set up a github account and get insights in the basic functionality by following this 15 min. tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 

* **2. R installation:** Download and install the latest R distribution under:  https://cran.r-project.org/ 

* **3. Rstudio installation:** Download and install the latest version of RStudio under: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 

* **4. Prepare some own content** you would like on the website (eg. about me, recent papers/projects description text etc. fx in Word; have a picture ready)
