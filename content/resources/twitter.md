By using social media, you will get a larger audience and can increase the reach of your research [(recent studies show how tweeting about research papers significantly increase the number of citations.)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497520308602) With a single tweet, you can quickly and easily reach out to people from all over the world. Twitter is a great and simple platform to share your content such as new publications, special issue calls, conference attendance or just your everyday research reflections without any special equipment other than your phone or computer. We will describe how it easily can be used for research dissemination. 

**If you want to try out Twitter, we will recommend you follow these tips** 

---
##### 1. Create a Twitter Bio 

Your Twitter bio is your 'business card'; use it to show your main research areas, your univeristy affiliation and other general interest. The 160 character limit requires some creativity.  
Even though you use Twitter for research dissemination make sure to show some personality as well. It can take a bit of practice to balance authenticity, networking and research dissemination. 
If you are blogging too, the Twitter bio is a great place to link to your blog.

##### 2. Keep it simple and post often  

A tweet can contain 280 characters - so your message needs to be brief but informative. 
For instance when tweeting about a new publication, it can be more fruitful to post a sentence representing your main findings rather than the more formal 'titel, journal outlet'-combination. Remember to save some characters for linking to relevant sources. 

If tweeting on a high content topic, you can create a thread of coupled tweets by tapping 'Continue Thread' and add to your last Tweet.

If you are making short tweets you make it easier for your network to retweet. By tweeting regularly, you have a better opportunity to reach more followers and those who maybe missed your first tweets. 

At first you might not have much content to tweet yourself, but retweeting or citing tweets from others are also easy approaches to creating engagement and get a feel of the platform.

##### 3. Use pictures, videos and gifs in your tweets 

Use pictures, videos and gifs to stand out in your followersâ€™ feed and get more feedback. This is a great way to make your content more engaging and visual.

##### 4. Use relevant hashtags 

Hastags work as keyword or topic enhancers for your tweets.  
By using relevant hashtags, you enhance your visibility, and it becomes easier for others to find your tweets. Using hashtags is a great way to make sure that the right people see your tweets and not just the ones that already follow you. Anyone interested in your hashtag may find and read your content because of that specific hashtag that you wrote. 

Explore broad hashtags that are related to your content. From there you can go deeper, and consider where you want to direct the attention of your tweets. For dialogue in many danish areas use #dk and then follow with the field e.g. #dkudd for danish education. 
For more informal knowledge sharing and networking, check out #AcademicTwitter, #AcademicChatter etc. 

A great way to locate hashtags is to get inspired by other academics within your field. Otherwise there are platforms to help you locate relevant hashtags such as Ritetag.com. The website will suggest hashtags to get seen now and hashtags to get seen over time. This is a great platform if you need inspiration to locate relevant hashtags for your content in only a few minutes. 

Avoid hashtag overload: 2-3 well-chosen hashtags will be enough to ensure visibility and attention to your tweet.

##### 5. Seek out relevant followers  

Twitter is a great platform to connect with peers and get a larger audience.  Follow others with relevance within your field and if they find your content (or perhaps just your bio) interesting, they might follow you back. This is the first step in growing your digital research network. 

The activity of engaging with peers on twitter can be a preparatory activity prior to conference attendance to grow your visibility within the field and prepare short coffee-meetings during conferences.  During conferences, livetweeting can provide a foundation for sharing input from e.g. key notes, interesting paper sessions etc. and create a path for engagement with other experts within the field.  

Many journals, conferences and networks have their own Twitter-account. Check out the relevant accounts within your field; they often retweet calls for papers, new research and field-relevant activities.  

Another approach to mapping potential relevant stakeholders is to create your own Twitter Lists where you can outline relevant research themes and follow them in a separate twitter feed (e.g. by using TweetDeck). Each time you add a Twitter user to a list, they are notified and can follow the theme and development of the list. This is an excellent way of initiating informal dialogue with peers.

##### 6. Share your publications 

Sharing your publications on Twitter can be an easy way to get feedback and maybe it will result in new followers as well. Recent studies show how tweeting about research papers significantly increase the number of citations. Rather than posting the abstract, summarize the key findings or key points of discussion in 1-2 short sentences as an appetizer for the reader to follow. Remember to post a link to the journal paper/research gate og VBN.  


---
##### 7. Learn from other successful people on Twitter 

Check out what other academics are posting and how they have set up their accounts to get inspiration for your own. 

The use of twitter presupposes engagement; allocate time to grow your feed and engage with your peers.

 ##### 8. Other considerations when using Twitter for research dissemination
 
Time management - Scrolling through Twitter can easily become a process of procrastination. Decide how much time you want to spend engaging on Twitter and try to stay within your limit. 
 
Personal or professional accounts? On Twitter you can manage multiple accounts, so if you prefer you can set up an account solely for research dissemination. This also goes for external communication from e.g. research groups or research projects.  

Be aware you cannot edit published tweets - but typing errors are a part of the charm of Twitter..
